README 

THIS README IS FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM... 

CRC-16 Calculator and verifier. 

This program is designed to calculate the CRC of a given file and appends it to the end for the file. 
also if we are given a file that already has a CRC=16 attached to it it will be verified. 

Program Structure: 

This program will have 4 classes each with its own set of methods. Each class is represented by the MENU 
on the beginning prompt for the user. plus a utilities class that will have multiple applications 
thoughout the program. These will have JavaDoc for further reading of the method and class functionality
but essentially they will do what the name describes. 

CRCMain - main class of the program. has other methods to set up initial interface and UI. 

CRCCalculator - class for calculating the CRC and appending it to the end of the file. 

CRCValidator - class for validating the CRC 

Utilities - class for tools used throughout the program. 

executables 

a .java file will be supplied within the zip. therefore it should be a simple double click straight to
the terminal. If for any reason that this doesn't happen, then I am a horrible package distributor and 
should be flogged.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE!!!

replace your file with the testfilepath.txt and run the program in any terminal.

I am using Intellij Idea 15 for reference to package manager. 

Java 8 JDK used as well for further troubleshooting. 

MORE DETAILS SOON (04.06.16)
